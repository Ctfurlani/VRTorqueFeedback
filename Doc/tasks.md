# Tasks

## Docking
Spawn objects in different places (maybe a big shelf?), so the user can manipulate them and we make sure he is not biased/conditioned with the positions.

Maybe a separate task for time and precision?
Catalog: time and precision (how far from ideal position, for each dimension)

## Ordering
N objects are spawned, to be positioned, in order of weight, in N spacious slots / areas.
The user is informed there can be objets with the same weight. If the user can't distinguish the weight of some objects, or he thinks they are the same weight, they should be positioned in the same order/slot/area.

Change N to analyse "resolution" of the system (how many weights can the user distinguish?): 3, 5, ...
Catalog: time and order/positioning

___

### Considerations
Play with textures, sizes and shapes? Sometimes correspondence between weights and textures, sometimes not. Can we fool visual influence?

### Future Tasks
#### Stacking
Catalog: time (total and per object, for each layer) and #objects stacked until fall. Wait for collision feedback to be implemented.

posicionar (docking) e compara��o de pesos pura (ordenar objetos por peso, brincar com texturas e formatos, tamanhos - as vezes corresponder ou nao, e ver quanto o visual tem influencia, se conseguimos vencer essa influencia)
